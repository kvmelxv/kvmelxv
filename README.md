# 👋 Hi, I’m Mustapha Kamel Cherif

## 💻 About Me

I’m a passionate **software engineering student** and web developer based in Montreal. I enjoy building modern, high-performance applications that solve real problems. With a background in web development, I’m constantly seeking new challenges and learning opportunities. My interests lie in full-stack development, software architecture, and creating intuitive user experiences.

- 🌱 I’m currently sharpening my skills in **Java**, **Maven**, **JUnit**, and **IntelliJ IDEA**, while deepening my understanding of software architecture and development tools
- 🚀 I’m working on several web and software projects involving **web apps**, **mobile-friendly UIs**, and **RESTful APIs**
- 🛠️ Main stack for web development: **React**, **Next.js**, **Node.js**, **PostgreSQL**, **TailwindCSS**, **Git**
- 🧰 Also experienced in non-web software development using **Java** and standard tools like **Maven**, **JUnit**, and **IntelliJ IDEA**
- 🗃️ Exploring tools like **Supabase**, **Docker**, and **GitHub Actions**
